# Shared shell-text scanner for the PreToolUse gate hooks (guard-recursive-delete.sh,
# guard-git-work-loss.sh). Each hook loads it by concatenating this file in front
# of its own awk program: awk "$(cat lib-shell-words.awk)"'<program>'.
# Nothing here decides anything -- it turns the Bash tool's command string
# into words the hook judges.
#
# The hooks are gates, so every ambiguity here resolves toward MORE words
# reaching the hook, never fewer:
#   - an escaped command word (`r\m`, `\git`) becomes the plain word;
#   - a quoted string that holds whitespace stays one unresolvable word ("$Q")
#     AND is queued for a nested scan (texts_of), because `sh -c '...'`,
#     `eval "..."` and `xargs -I{} sh -c '...'` execute exactly that text;
#   - a redirection and its operand are dropped, so `2>&1` is never a target;
#   - a `#` comment is dropped to end of line;
#   - `{` / `}` standing alone are separators (`{ cmd; }`, find's `{}`), but
#     glued to a word they stay in it (`dist{,2}`, `${VAR}`), so brace
#     expansion reaches the hook as a word it can refuse to resolve.
# Anything the scanner gets wrong should therefore surface as a spurious
# word in the hook, i.e. a false deny that names the command, not a bypass.

# Drop every heredoc body: from the end of the line carrying <<WORD to the
# line that is exactly WORD. The marker itself becomes a plain word. Runs on
# the raw text before scan(), so a `<<EOF` inside quotes is stripped too --
# a doc that *mentions* a command is not that command either way. With an
# unquoted delimiter (<<EOF, <<-EOF) the shell runs the body's command
# substitutions, so those stay behind, each on a line of its own
# (sw_hd_subs), and scan() reads them as commands like any other $(...).
# Any quote or backslash in the word (<<'EOF', <<E"O"F, <<\EOF) quotes it.
# The rest of the opener line stays, and every opener on it takes its body
# in turn from the lines below, as the shell does. A body whose closing line
# never comes stays as it is, read as commands. `<<<` is a here-string, not
# an opener. The search resumes after each heredoc, never inside what it
# kept, so a `<<X` in a kept substitution cannot pair with a later X line.
